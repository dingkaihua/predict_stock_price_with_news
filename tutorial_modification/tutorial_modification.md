# Modified Tutorial on Toward Data Science named [Outstanding results predicting Apple Stock with Continual ML using Global News (with Python)](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-a-continual-ml-pipeline-to-predict-apple-stock-with-global-news-python-90e5d6610b21)


I argue that the claimed accuracy obatined by this tutorial is due to its ML model and stock price vectors (high, low, open, close, etc). Not the news component. I tested the effective of news in stock price predictions, by chopping off news from ML model's training vectors, then comparing against the original model.
